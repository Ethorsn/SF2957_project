We aim to implement an \textbf{reinforcement learning} algorithm which can play the card game \textbf{blackjack}. Some of the recourses to be used are course material on reinforcement learning, the reference given by the project description https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01121.pdf as well as other literature such as http://cs.ou.edu/~granville/paper.pdf.

A short outline of what the project will include, but is not limited to, is presented below.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A working reinforcement algorithm which is able to play blackjack using the existing blackjack libraries, ex. OpenAI Gym: https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/lib/envs/blackjack.py.
\item Code in python 3.6 together with tensorflow whenever possible.
\item Github repository available for future participants to work with.
\end{enumerate}

If time permits we will also...
